**HyperGodot Demo of a Third-Person Controller**

This is a very basic demo with a few bugs. It's main goal is to showcase a third person game that uses the [hypercore protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/) for multiplayer. We hope this can serve as a resource for others who may wish to use hypercore for p2p 3d multiplayer games.

# Controls
* wsad for movement 
* left mouse click for grappling hook 
* "x" for light toggle
* space bar for jump
* "r" to respawn
